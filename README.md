## COVID-19 Tracker Dashboard

### Project Overview
The COVID-19 Tracker Dashboard is an interactive and comprehensive visualization tool designed to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Created using Tableau, this dashboard integrates various datasets to present detailed statistics on testing, vaccination, case counts, and more. The goal is to offer an easy-to-understand visual representation of the pandemic's impact across different states and demographics in India.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Maps:** Visualize COVID-19 case counts, deaths, and testing facilities across Indian states.
- **Vaccination Statistics:** Track the number of doses administered, segmented by vaccine type (Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V).
- **Age and Gender Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of cases by age groups and gender.
- **Statewise Testing Details:** Comprehensive view of testing statistics, including the number of tests conducted in each state.
- **ICMR Testing Labs:** Geographical distribution of ICMR-approved testing laboratories.

### Technologies Used
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **CSV Files:** Data source files containing information about age groups, testing labs, state boundaries, individual details, and state-wise testing.
- **Shapefiles:** Geospatial data to map state boundaries.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered data from multiple sources, including CSV files and shapefiles, to ensure a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Data Integration:** Integrated various datasets into Tableau to create a unified data source for visualization.
3. **Dashboard Design:** Designed the dashboard with interactive elements, such as maps, charts, and filters, to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Ensured the accuracy and reliability of the visualizations by cross-referencing with raw data and performing validation checks.

### Conclusion
The COVID-19 Dashboard serves as a powerful tool to understand the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. By leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, the dashboard provides users with a clear and interactive way to explore critical data. It helps in making informed decisions and gaining insights into the effectiveness of testing and vaccination efforts across the country.
